# The Cycle of Socialization: A Visual Model

This project visualizes an individualâ€™s lifetime within the cycle of socialization, where distinct shapes and colors represent people of diverse identities encountered throughout their life. Initially, the individual is limited by fear, confusion, insecurity, and ignorance, which restrict their understanding of systemic oppression and the roles dictated by society. As they engage in education, self-reflection, and empowerment, they become more open to interacting with these diverse individuals. The visualization illustrates this journey, showing how the identities gradually approach the person, symbolizing the expansion of their comfort zone and the first steps toward overcoming internalized oppression and liberating themselves and others from the cycle of socialization.
